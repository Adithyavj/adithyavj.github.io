### Introduction
In this blog, we will go through the basics of stock market trading/investing.

### Why Stock Trading?
Two of the main reasons to be involved in stock trading are:
1. Trade/Invest your money to generate income.
2. Trade other people's money to generate income.
So the basic purpose is to generate capital. Everyone has to learn about the stock market at one point or the other in their lives.

### What is a Stock?
A Stock is a security that signifies ownership in a corporation. By having stocks in a company you have claim on their assets and earnings. 
By owning stocks/shares in a company you become a part owner of the firm. A company sells/issues its stocks when it needs to grow by raising a capital. The investor who buys the stock can participate in the growth of the company by owning a part of it (He doesn't even need to put in work). Traders look for mispricing of stock and if they are able to evaluate when the price is too high or too low, they can take advantage of it and make profit.

Buying a stock:
It depends on whether the stock is private/public.
1. Private company:
A private company is one with relatively small amount of owners and doesn't trade on public exchanges.

It is relatively not easy to invest in private companies. We need to be either acquainted with the owner or be a qualified investor with a lot of money. Thus it's difficult for private companies to get funded. 

2. Public company 
A public company is a big company that trades on the public exchange. eg:- Apple, Meta, Netflix

Anybody can invest in public companies. You can buy it's stocks using the brokers form the public exchange where it is traded.

### What is a Market?
A market is a location where people go to buy and sell products. Markets are characterised by the products that they specialize in. The Stock market works like an auction market. In an auction market, buyers bid on the best price that they are willing to pay for a product and sellers bid on the price on which they are willing to sell the product. There are two types of stock markets
1. Primary Market: The market that the stock trades in the first time.
2. Secondary Market: Every other time that the stock trades after the first time.The stock becomes second hand. ie, somebody else owned it before you.
