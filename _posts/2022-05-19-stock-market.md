### Introduction
In this blog, we will go through the basics of stock market trading/investing.

### Why Stock Trading?
Two of the main reasons to be involved in stock trading are:
1. Trade/Invest your money to generate income.
2. Trade other people's money to generate income.  
So the basic purpose is to generate capital. Everyone has to learn about the stock market at one point or the other in their lives.

### What is a Stock?
A Stock is a security that signifies ownership in a corporation. By having stocks in a company you have claim on their assets and earnings. 
By owning stocks/shares in a company you become a part owner of the firm. A company sells/issues its stocks when it needs to grow by raising a capital. The investor who buys the stock can participate in the growth of the company by owning a part of it (He doesn't even need to put in work). Traders look for mispricing of stock and if they are able to evaluate when the price is too high or too low, they can take advantage of it and make profit.

Buying a stock:
It depends on whether the stock is private/public.
- **Private company**:  
A private company is one with relatively small amount of owners and doesn't trade on public exchanges.

It is relatively not easy to invest in private companies. We need to be either acquainted with the owner or be a qualified investor with a lot of money. Thus it's difficult for private companies to get funded. 

- **Public company**:  
A public company is a big company that trades on the public exchange. eg:- Apple, Meta, Netflix

Anybody can invest in public companies. You can buy it's stocks using the brokers from the public exchange where it is traded.

### What is a Market?
A market is a location where people go to buy and sell products. Markets are characterised by the products that they specialize in. The Stock market works like an auction market. In an auction market, buyers bid on the best price that they are willing to pay for a product and sellers bid on the price on which they are willing to sell the product. There are two types of stock markets
1. Primary Market: The market that the stock trades in the first time.
2. Secondary Market: Every other time that the stock trades after the first time.The stock becomes second hand. ie, somebody else owned it before you.  

> In order for a company to go public, it needs to go through an **IPO (Initial Public Offering)**
#### IPO (Initial Public Offering)
Selling stocks from your company to the public for the first time ever. The public will pay for the part of the company you sale to them.
An underwriting firm will analyse our company and figure out the best price at which our stock can be sold at the beginning. They help us get the required amount of money by
selling the decided amount of stocks. The first selling of these stocks/shares will happen in the primary market. It is very hard to get shares from the primary market (ie, through IPO). When we talk about the buying and selling of stocks/securities we will talk about the secondary market.

### What is an Stock Exchange?
Exhanges refer to the exact location where the trades are being executed. 
eg: Let's take the case of grocery stores. The term can be compared to that of a Market. But if we refer to a specific store, like Walmart, these can be compared to
an exchange.  
In the Stock Market, we have different exchanges that we can goto to buy and sell stocks. eg: NYSE (NewYork Stock Exchange), Nasdaq  
Back in the 1700's or 1800's, to buy a stock, we had to find a person who wanted to sell our required quantity of a stock at the price which we are willing to buy it. It was a very difficult process. So, there were regular meetups in the townhalls and in city centers where people meet and trade stocks. One of those was in New York where financially savy people met and sold/bought stocks. A group of people who started this saw that it was a hassle dealing with lots of people to meet up like this so, they decided to sign an agreement with one another called the buttonwood agreement. The agreement said that they weren't going to trade stocks with anyone else but themselves (they were 24 people). If someone wanted to buy/sell stocks from them, they were going to charge a commission (a percentage). This location was called the New York Stock Exhange (It originally consisted of 24 brokers). The three main exchanges in the United States are :  
- NYSE - Biggest and most demanding exchange (They look at the company before listing in this exchange)
- Nasdaq - Less demanding and most tech companies are on this exchange
- Amex - It is an exchange that caters to ETF's (Exchange Traded Funds)
Some companies are listed in more than one exchange, But mostly they are only listed in one exchange

### What is a Broker?
A broker is somebody who you're going to have to go through to buy/sell a stock. When you want to buy a stock, you have to go to the broker and let him know what stock you want to buy. He will see if another brokers client wants to sell the stock that you want to buy and see if your prices match so that you can transact with one another. As the brokers became more busy, they hired floor brokers. Earlier everything was done manually where the floor brokers would meet physically but with time, it became automated where we can execute orders using a computer and thus didn't require floor brokers. However, we still have to go through the broker to request that we want to buy/sell the stock only the match-making process at the exchange is automated. We have to pay a commission to the broker for them to route the order to the exchange and do the necessary paper work.

### Orders and Order Types
Here, we will discuss what we have to do when we want to buy/sell a stock. We already know we have to contact a broker for this but what should we tell him. We have to send the broker an order of what you want. The things that need to be specified in an order are:  
- Ticker - An abbreviation for the name of the company eg: Microsoft(MSFT)
- Side - Buy/Sell order
- Type - Market order, Limit order. Market order tells a broker that you want to buy/sell the stock immediately no matter the price. Limit order tells a broker you want to buy/sell the stock at a limit price or better. Market order is time sensitive while limit order is price sensitive. In case of a limit order, we need to provide a price to your order.
- Quantity - No. of shares to buy/sell

### Order Driving Prices
Most people think that it's news or events that make prices move, but the actual thing that drives prices is orders that people send. 
> Shares outstanding refers to the amount of shares that your company has.  
> Floats: The amount of shares that are currently trading in the market.

- **Level 2/Book**: Represents every single buyer and seller that's out on the market. From the book or level 2 we create level 1. In level 2, the orders on the buy side are placed according to a price priority and then time priority. The order with the highest price is placed on top of the buy side and the one with lowest price is placed at the top of the sell side. If two orders have the same price, then the one which came first will be on top. Level 2 updates everytime a new order is placed. The order at the top of level 2 buy part is the best ask and the one at the top of it's sell part is the best bid. *Electronic list of buy and sell orders for a stock. This list is ordered by price and then by time. The order book lists the number of shares on the bid and ask at every price point*.  
- **Level 1**: It is the best price/bid/offer available on the market. It is updated everytime the best ask/best bid in the level 2 gets updated. Level 1 is an abbreviation for level 2 and Time and Sales. It contains the best ask/bid from level 2 and the last price from Time and Sales. It will give us a general idea of the market. *Displays the bid and ask prices as well as quantities. This also displays the last trade executed*.  
- **Time and Sales**: This is where the exchange records everything. The exchange has to report on every execution that happens. On it they have to put the name of the stock that they are trading, the time that the trade happened at, the quantity and the price that it happened at. This comes out at the time of sales. The last price at which the stock was executed at is the LTP and will be shown while checking for the price of the stock. *Displays every single execution that happens on the market. The executions are displayed real-time and include information like: time, direction, quantity traded and exchange traded on*.  

**Supply and demand** is shown through the order book that you can access at level 2, see all the buyers and all the sellers and the price will fluctuate based solely on the orders that people send. The price movement comes from the order matching with one another on the execution system/the matching system at the stock exchange.

- Bid: The best price you can buy on.  
- Ask: The best price you can sell on.  
- Spread: Difference between ask and bid. The difference between the price of best person who wants to buy and the person who wants to sell. If a stock has an ask of 52 and a bid of 50 and we want to buy it, we can buy it at 52$ and if we sell it next we will sell it at 50$. Thus loosing 2$ in the process even though the stock hasn't moved.  The 2$ is spread. While trading we have to watch out for the spread of a stock.
- NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer): This represents the highest bid and lowest ask available on the market
