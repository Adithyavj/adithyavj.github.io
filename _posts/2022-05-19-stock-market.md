### Introduction
In this blog, we will go through the basics of stock market trading/investing.

### Why Stock Trading?
Two of the main reasons to be involved in stock trading are:
1. Trade/Invest your money to generate income.
2. Trade other people's money to generate income.  
So the basic purpose is to generate capital. Everyone has to learn about the stock market at one point or the other in their lives.

### What is a Stock?
A Stock is a security that signifies ownership in a corporation. By having stocks in a company you have claim on their assets and earnings. 
By owning stocks/shares in a company you become a part owner of the firm. A company sells/issues its stocks when it needs to grow by raising a capital. The investor who buys the stock can participate in the growth of the company by owning a part of it (He doesn't even need to put in work). Traders look for mispricing of stock and if they are able to evaluate when the price is too high or too low, they can take advantage of it and make profit.

Buying a stock:
It depends on whether the stock is private/public.
- **Private company**:  
A private company is one with relatively small amount of owners and doesn't trade on public exchanges.

It is relatively not easy to invest in private companies. We need to be either acquainted with the owner or be a qualified investor with a lot of money. Thus it's difficult for private companies to get funded. 

- **Public company**:  
A public company is a big company that trades on the public exchange. eg:- Apple, Meta, Netflix

Anybody can invest in public companies. You can buy it's stocks using the brokers from the public exchange where it is traded.

### What is a Market?
A market is a location where people go to buy and sell products. Markets are characterised by the products that they specialize in. The Stock market works like an auction market. In an auction market, buyers bid on the best price that they are willing to pay for a product and sellers bid on the price on which they are willing to sell the product. There are two types of stock markets
1. Primary Market: The market that the stock trades in the first time.
2. Secondary Market: Every other time that the stock trades after the first time.The stock becomes second hand. ie, somebody else owned it before you.  

> In order for a company to go public, it needs to go through an **IPO (Initial Public Offering)**
#### IPO (Initial Public Offering)
Selling stocks from your company to the public for the first time ever. The public will pay for the part of the company you sale to them.
An underwriting firm will analyse our company and figure out the best price at which our stock can be sold at the beginning. They help us get the required amount of money by
selling the decided amount of stocks. The first selling of these stocks/shares will happen in the primary market. It is very hard to get shares from the primary market (ie, through IPO). When we talk about the buying and selling of stocks/securities we will talk about the secondary market.

### What is an Stock Exchange?
Exhanges refer to the exact location where the trades are being executed. 
eg: Let's take the case of grocery stores. The term can be compared to that of a Market. But if we refer to a specific store, like Walmart, these can be compared to
an exchange.  
In the Stock Market, we have different exchanges that we can goto to buy and sell stocks. eg: NYSE (NewYork Stock Exchange), Nasdaq  
Back in the 1700's or 1800's, to buy a stock, we had to find a person who wanted to sell our required quantity of a stock at the price which we are willing to buy it. It was a very difficult process. So, there were regular meetups in the townhalls and in city centers where people meet and trade stocks. One of those was in New York where financially savy people met and sold/bought stocks. A group of people who started this saw that it was a hassle dealing with lots of people to meet up like this so, they decided to sign an agreement with one another called the buttonwood agreement. The agreement said that they weren't going to trade stocks with anyone else but themselves (they were 24 people). If someone wanted to buy/sell stocks from them, they were going to charge a commission (a percentage). This location was called the New York Stock Exhange (It originally consisted of 24 brokers). The three main exchanges in the United States are :  
- NYSE - Biggest and most demanding exchange (They look at the company before listing in this exchange)
- Nasdaq - Less demanding and most tech companies are on this exchange
- Amex - It is an exchange that caters to ETF's (Exchange Traded Funds)
Some companies are listed in more than one exchange, But mostly they are only listed in one exchange

### What is a Broker?
A broker is somebody who you're going to have to go through to buy/sell a stock. When you want to buy a stock, you have to go to the broker and let him know what stock you want to buy. He will see if another brokers client wants to sell the stock that you want to buy and see if your prices match so that you can transact with one another. As the brokers became more busy, they hired floor brokers. Earlier everything was done manually where the floor brokers would meet physically but with time, it became automated where we can execute orders using a computer and thus didn't require floor brokers. However, we still have to go through the broker to request that we want to buy/sell the stock only the match-making process at the exchange is automated. We have to pay a commission to the broker for them to route the order to the exchange and do the necessary paper work.

### Orders and Order Types
Here, we will discuss what we have to do when we want to buy/sell a stock. We already know we have to contact a broker for this but what should we tell him. We have to send the broker an order of what you want. The things that need to be specified in an order are:  
- Ticker - An abbreviation for the name of the company eg: Microsoft(MSFT)
- Side - Buy/Sell order
- Type - Market order, Limit order. Market order tells a broker that you want to buy/sell the stock immediately no matter the price. Limit order tells a broker you want to buy/sell the stock at a limit price or better. Market order is time sensitive while limit order is price sensitive. In case of a limit order, we need to provide a price to your order.
- Quantity - No. of shares to buy/sell

### Order Driving Prices
Most people think that it's news or events that make prices move, but the actual thing that drives prices is orders that people send. 
> Shares outstanding refers to the amount of shares that your company has.  
> Floats: The amount of shares that are currently trading in the market.

- **Level 2/Book**: Represents every single buyer and seller that's out on the market. From the book or level 2 we create level 1. In level 2, the orders on the buy side are placed according to a price priority and then time priority. The order with the highest price is placed on top of the buy side and the one with lowest price is placed at the top of the sell side. If two orders have the same price, then the one which came first will be on top. Level 2 updates everytime a new order is placed. The order at the top of level 2 buy part is the best ask and the one at the top of it's sell part is the best bid. *Electronic list of buy and sell orders for a stock. This list is ordered by price and then by time. The order book lists the number of shares on the bid and ask at every price point*.  
- **Level 1**: It is the best price/bid/offer available on the market. It is updated everytime the best ask/best bid in the level 2 gets updated. Level 1 is an abbreviation for level 2 and Time and Sales. It contains the best ask/bid from level 2 and the last price from Time and Sales. It will give us a general idea of the market. *Displays the bid and ask prices as well as quantities. This also displays the last trade executed*.  
- **Time and Sales**: This is where the exchange records everything. The exchange has to report on every execution that happens. On it they have to put the name of the stock that they are trading, the time that the trade happened at, the quantity and the price that it happened at. This comes out at the time of sales. The last price at which the stock was executed at is the LTP and will be shown while checking for the price of the stock. *Displays every single execution that happens on the market. The executions are displayed real-time and include information like: time, direction, quantity traded and exchange traded on*.  

**Supply and demand** is shown through the order book that you can access at level 2, see all the buyers and all the sellers and the price will fluctuate based solely on the orders that people send. The price movement comes from the order matching with one another on the execution system/the matching system at the stock exchange.

- Bid: The best price you can buy on.  
- Ask: The best price you can sell on.  
- Spread: Difference between ask and bid. The difference between the price of best person who wants to buy and the person who wants to sell. If a stock has an ask of 52 and a bid of 50 and we want to buy it, we can buy it at 52$ and if we sell it next we will sell it at 50$. Thus loosing 2$ in the process even though the stock hasn't moved.  The 2$ is spread. While trading we have to watch out for the spread of a stock.
- NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer): This represents the highest bid and lowest ask available on the market.

### Different Players
Different players in the market trade differently. A mutual fund or somebody who has a lot of shares is not going to trade like somebody who is just sitting at home and trading ie, a retail trader. A mutual fund will sell when there's a good news since then, a lot of buyers will be there. We have to know the institutional ownership of a stock. We need to know who we are trading against. At the end of the day, day-trade is a zero sum game meaning every dollar that we take into our pocket comes from somebody elses pocket. So, we need to know the person we're taking money from. Prices are going to move because of the buy orders and sell orders that people/participants are sending so we have to know who those participants are. Because they send orders in a different type of manner.
The different players are:
- Proprietary Trading Firms (Have lots of tools, information, access and strategies)
- Investors (They invest for a long term)
- Retail Traders (Traders trading from home without sophisticated tools, information or strategies)
- Portfolio Managers (Mutual fund managers - Take money from lot of investors and trade using it)
- Hedge Funds - Like mutual funds, they have big capital and not anyone can put money in a hedge fund. You have to be someone who's rich enough as they have a minimun investment amount. They are more sophisticated than mutual funds and outperform them. They are very discrete (We can't know what they are doing.)

### 3 ways of making money in Stock Market
1. Going Long - Buying a stock and selling it at a higher valuation to make money.
2. Going Short - Betting that a stock is gonna go down. We make money when stock drops in value. We can short stocks in a margin account. Here we borrow stocks from a broker, then sell it and after it goes down buy it back, take the difference as profit and give back the stock to the broker.
3. Being Flat - Being flat means having no positions. If you're busy then don't trade, this is a good position to be in.

### Introduction to Technical Analysis
We have two ways to try and predict where stock prices are going to go. These two are:
- Fundamental Analysis (Evaluating the stock fundamentally - how many employees, tax system, environment, revenue, expenses, debt) - Used for long term investing
- Technical Analysis (We only check Price and Volume of shares being traded) - Used for trading (Day trading, swing trading)  

### Charts & Candlesticks
**Chart** - Charts are just a graphical representations of past price action. Chart is the prices that a product traded at each point in time. When looking at a chart, we are observing historical prices of a stock. Prices going up indicates that the demand for the stock was higher than it's supply. If prices are going down, it mean more people wanted to sell that product and less people wanted to buy it. Traders use charts to predict where the stock go in the future based on how it moved in the past.
1. Line Charts
It connects every price point throughout time with a line. Line charts aren't sufficient enough to get a full picture of what actually happend. That's why almost always we use candlestick charts.
2. Candlestock Charts
Candlestick is something we draw for each day. A candlestick shows opening price, close price, high price, and low price during a day. In the US and Canadian markets, the market opens at 9:30am, the first trade that happens when the market opens is the opening price. If the first trade happens at 10$, it is the opening price. If the stock price then goes down to 9$, then goes up to 13$ and closes at 12$. Close is the last trade that happend during the day. ie, at 4pm when the market closes. The highest price that the stock traded during the day here 13$ is the high price and the lowest price that the stock traded in during the day 9$ is the low price. By connecting these prices we form a candle. By looking at this candle, it's top shows the high price, bottom show low price. If a candle is drawn in green, it means it's price went up today. It opened at 10$ went down to 9$ but closed at 12$. So in effect it went up by 2$ or 20%. Another example is a stock opened at 10$, went up to 12$, then went down to 6$ and closed at 8$. So here the candlestick will be red color and the price went down by 2$ or 20%.

All candles are composed of an upper shadow, lower shadow, open, close, high, and low.  
If the open is higher than the close we have a red.  
If the close is higher than the open we have a green.  

### CandleSticks
A graphical representation of the high, low, opening and closing price of a security for a specific period. A green Real Body represents a stock that closed at a higher price than it opened at. A red Real Body represents a stock that closed at a price lower than it opened at. A candlestick can be for any period of time. It can be for a day, a week, for 5 minutes etc. We can have candles for any timeframes. Different candles mean different things.
The different candlesticks are:
1. Big Candles  
As the name suggests, a big candle is a candle of a large size. It indicates that the prices either went down a lot or went up a lot. A bigger candle means a bigger imbalance between how many buyers there were and how many sellers.
2. Dojis Candles  
Doji means indecision. Dojis form when the opening and closing prices are virtually equal. Alone, dojis are neutral patterns. It opens at a price say 10$, then goes up to 14$, then goes down to 8$ they goes up to 10$. It's opening and closing prices are the same ie, 10$. This indicates indecision of where the stock should go. Neither buyer nor seller wins here.
3. Long Legger Doji Candles  
A Doji with a bigger wick (Wick referes to the high and low on a candle). It means buyers were winning by a bigger amount at one point but then sellers were winning by a bigger amount. But at the end of the day/period, the closing price of the stock is the same as the opening. Which means there is big indecision about where the stock is going.
4. GraveStone Candles  
Here the stock goes all the way up to a certain point meaning there are a lot of buyers (Strong demand) but then it stops and sellers start selling and the price drops all the way to where it opened at. The long upper shadow suggests that the direction of the trend may be nearing a major turning point. It is formed when the opening and closing price of the underlying asset are equal and occur at the low of the day. 
5. DragonFly Candles  
Here the stock opens at a price, drops then comes back to the opening price and closes there. The long lower shadow suggests that the direction of the trend may be nearing a major turning point. It is formed when the opening and closing price of the underlying asset are equal and occur at the high of the day. 
6. Morning Doji Star  
Morning Doji Star Consists of a large red body candlestick followed by a Doji that occurred below the preceding candlestick. On the following day, a third green body candlestick is formed that closed well into the red body candlestick which appeared before the Doji. It is considered as a major reversal signal. Indicates a bullish trend.
Stock goes down with red candlestick until it reaches a doji indicating an indecision, then next candle is a green one. This forms a reverse signal indicating that it may go up subsequently. Dojis make sense when put within a pattern. We can us the morning doji star pattern to time the buying of a stock. If it forms the morning star pattern, we know it will go up eventually so we can time it here and buy it.
7. Evening Doji Star  
Evening Doji Star Consists of three candlesticks. First is a large green body candlestick followed by a Doji that gap above the green body. The third candlestick is a red body that closes well into the green body. When it appears at the top it is considered as a reversal signal. It signals a bearish trend.
8. Shooting Star  
Here the stock opens at a certain price, goes all the way up and come down and closes just above where it opened. It will have a small green candle. A black or a white candlestick that has a small body, a long upper shadow and a little or no lower tail. Considered a bearish pattern in an uptrend.
8. Hammer  
Here the stock opens at a certian price, goes all the way down and come up and closes just below where it opened. It will have a small red candle. A black or a white candlestick that consists of a small body near the high with a little or no upper shadow and a long lower tail. Considered a bullish pattern during a downtrend.
9. Bearish Harami  
Here we have a very big green candle and then a smaller red candle that opens within the body(within open and close of the candle) of the green candle. In a chart this indicatest that the up movement has exhaused. So, we expect a trend reveral ie, the stock to go down. As the name bearish suggests we have a view that the stock will go down.
10. Bullish Harami  
Here we have a very big red candle and then a smaller green candle that opens within the body(within open and close of the candle) of the red candle.
